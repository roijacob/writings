Hi, I'm Roi. I'm working at a startup as a data analyst. 

In my free time, I like to read articles (like the ones you are reading here). In this site, you can find my personal blogs. I will also be having a professional blog site on Substack; they are still in my notes yet (WIP).

### Quotes I Live By
> Rome wasn't built in a day.

> Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.

### Music
I'm a big fan of music! Here are some of my Spotify Wrapped playlists (useless flex):

If money didn't matter, I would probably be a musicianâ€”indie pop. I'm not a good singer, though, but hey, it's possible to sing in a speaking voice. ðŸ˜‰
