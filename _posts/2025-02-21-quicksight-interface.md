On the basic front, you would navigate QuickSight like this:

I guess it can be referred to as **toolbars**, like those present in software such as the Microsoft Office Suite. Additionally:

- The red box acts like a toggle, appearing in the sidebars when selected.
- The brown box contains the components that you can add to the dashboard.
- The buttons on the left of the red box are the undo and redo buttons.

If the toggles in the red box are unpressed, it would look like this:

It would be like a clean slate, where you really can't do anything unless you press something in the toolbar. The toolbar is what you would use 90% of the time to create and modify visual charts in QuickSight.
